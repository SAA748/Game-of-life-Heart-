    I've code red cells to gather in the shape of the heart.
When we start thre simulation red cells change its places 
and show us beatiful patterns

Rules:
   1 - Each cell no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
 
   2 -  Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

   3 - Each cell with one, two or three neighbors survives.

   4 - Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
